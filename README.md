Data was collected from the website: U.S. Energy Information Administration https://www.eia.gov/
THis dataset contains the Renewable energy production for each month from 1973 to february 2023.
This is the ideal dataset to make practice with time series analysis and forecasting
Finally I created a web-app with streamlit in order to manage time series dataset like this, checking for stationarity and forecasting
The web app is available at this link: https://time-series-forecasting---renewable-energy.streamlit.app/
